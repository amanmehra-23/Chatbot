# Medical Chatbot
1] Data Source: The GALE Encyclopedia of Medicine has been selected as the foundational data source for this initiative. The primary objective of this chatbot is to disseminate accurate health information and mitigate the spread of misinformation. The encyclopedia serves as a reliable, static source of information.
2] Data Extraction: The data was meticulously extracted utilizing the PyPDFLoader in conjunction with the Langchain module. This process involved segmenting the documents into manageable text chunks, each comprising approximately 500 words, resulting in a total of 7,020 discrete chunks. This methodology ensures a comprehensive coverage and accessibility of the information contained within the source material.
3] Embedding: The project employs the advanced embedding capabilities of the Hugging Face model, specifically the sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2, to transform queries into 384-dimensional vectors. This approach enhances the chatbot's ability to understand and process user queries with high accuracy.
4] Vector Database: Leveraging Faiss for a chatbot's vector database enhances response accuracy and relevance through efficient nearest neighbor searches. This ensures rapid and context-aware interactions, even as the dataset expands, maintaining a seamless user experience.
5] Llama 2: The project leverages Llama 2 as the preferred large language model (LLM) to interpret user queries. This selection is based on Llama 2's exceptional ability to generate relevant and accurate responses, ensuring the chatbot can effectively address the intricate nature of health-related inquiries. The model provides a scalable solution that can adapt to increasing demands and complexity of user interactions.
6]Chainlit introduces an advanced medical chatbot interface, blending seamless user engagement with features for reviewing medical histories and attaching files for future consultations. This innovation enhances patient-provider interactions, ensuring efficient access to critical healthcare information.
